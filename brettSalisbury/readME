At first I really struggled with personalizing my portfolio site.
It really looked bland and didn't resemble me much at all.
I think I did a much better job towards the end of fixing this 
by creating a personalized header with something I am really interested in
along with a logo of my intials. I thought that ny color layout and typographic choices are probably
the strongest aspect of my worksite and create a nice minimalistic look.
    
Where I struggled the most is within getting the images to sit on my grid in a 
consistent manner. Before they would glitch out or shrink too large or small
but that appears to be fixed for the most part.My layout of the site really just comes
down to my top nav bar which is an image, then my about me contains a short paragraph 
with my resume linked within. After this I have a bar titled "works" to transition 
into the image grid itself. The whole page is a continuous scroller page, I thought
this would just function more smoothly and was a little more different than what I 
was seeing others do.
